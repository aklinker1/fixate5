# Fixate File Explorer

This is **version 5** of the application, and yes, all 5 versions were complete rewrites! Versions 3-5 all have similarities though, I started to settle down in my style at that point, but 1, 2, and 3 are completely different.

- [Version 4](https://github.com/aklinker1/fixate4) - Android Architecture Components came out
- [Version 3](https://github.com/aklinker1/Fixate3) - I kinda knew what I was doing
- [Version 2](https://github.com/aklinker1/Fixate-File-Manager) - Lol
- Version 1 (_Not on GitHub_) - I'm glad it's not on GitHub

> It's fun to see how I've grown over the years
